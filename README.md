## Contribute

If you have an idea or the need for a new feature for Data Populator, or run into a limitation you'd like to overcome – feel free to implement it and send us a [Pull Request](https://github.com/dataliterate/data-populator/pulls). We think the code architecture is understandable and modular enough to extend easily.

If you're a Designer and don't know how to code, kindly ask a Developer colleague or friend of yours – they'll kindly help you, as this is an investment in improving [Designer's Data Literacy](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/designing-with-meaningful-data-5456b40e172e) and Designer-Developer-Collaboration.
